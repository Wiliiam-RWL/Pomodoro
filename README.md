## What is Pomodoro?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros." After completing four pomodoros, a longer break is taken. This technique helps to improve concentration and avoid mental fatigue.
